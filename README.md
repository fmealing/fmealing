# Hi, I'm Florian 👋

I'm a Mechatronic and Robotic Engineering student who loves building things that live in the real world.

My work sits at the intersection of embedded systems, robotics, and full-stack software. I've built everything from an ESP32-based smart glove that tracks gym workouts, to autonomous robots, to full production web and mobile apps.

I'm also the founder of SyncMove, a social fitness platform I designed and built from scratch.
